# Jackify Changelog

## v0.2.2.2 - ModOrganizer.ini Path Fixes for SD Card Installations
**Release Date:** TBD (Testing in progress)

### Bug Fixes
- **ModOrganizer.ini Path Mangling**: Fixed incorrect drive letter assignment when modlist is on SD card but vanilla game is on internal storage. Now uses gamePath drive letter as source of truth for vanilla game paths.
- **Proton Config Name Mismatch (Issues #150, #151)**: Fixed incorrect Proton names written to Steam config.vdf CompatToolMapping. Naive string conversion produced wrong names (e.g., `proton_9.0_(beta)` instead of `proton_9`). Now resolves correct internal names from `compatibilitytool.vdf` (third-party) or App ID mapping (Valve Proton). CachyOS and other community Proton builds in `compatibilitytools.d/` are now detected and selectable.
- **Removed Lorerim/Lost Legacy Proton Override**: No longer forces Proton 9 for specific modlists. ENB compatibility warnings are handled by the success dialog instead.

### Engine Updates
- **jackify-engine 0.4.7**: Fixed incorrect quoting/escaping of MO2 `customExecutables` by writing clean, unquoted Proton `Z:\...` paths in `ModOrganizer.ini`. This eliminates engine-side quote corruption that previously triggered SD card path mangling issues.

### Loggging Improvement
- **Debug External Command Logging**: When debug mode is enabled, Jackify now logs the full `protontricks` command line before execution, making it easier for advanced users to reproduce and troubleshoot Wine/Proton issues by running the same command manually.

---

## v0.2.2.1 - TTW Installer Pinning and Configure New Modlist CLI Fix
**Release Date:** 2026-01-24

### Bug Fixes
- **Configure New Modlist CLI**: Fixed manual Proton setup prompts appearing in CLI. Now uses automated prefix workflow like the install command.
- **TTW_Linux_Installer Version Pinning**: Pinned to v0.0.7. Will re-introduce latest version following more testing.

---

## v0.2.2 - VNV Automation and First-Launch Improvements
**Release Date:** 2026-01-21

### Major Features
- **Viva New Vegas Post-Install Automation (experimental)**: Full automated workflow for the Viva New Vegas modlist. Handles root files copying, 4GB patcher, and BSA decompression as per the VNV install guide. This is an initial pass at automating this, so considered experimental.
- **Game Directory Pre-Creation**: Automatically creates My Documents/My Games and AppData/Local directories for some. Prevents some first-launch failures where games can't initialize under Proton. Supports Skyrim SE, FNV, FO4, Oblivion, Oblivion Remastered, Enderal, and Starfield so far.

### Bug Fixes
- **Configure Existing Modlist**: Fixed AttributeError when VNV automation check runs after configuration completes
- **Enderal Directory Creation**: Fixed bug where Enderal My Documents directory was created for all modlists instead of only Enderal

### Improvements
- **Winetricks Bundling**: Implemented Wine wrapper scripts that replicate protontricks' environment setup for improved reliability

---

## v0.2.1.1 - Bug Fixes and Improvements
**Release Date:** 2026-01-15

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **AppImage Crash on Steam Deck**: Fixed `NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined` that prevented AppImage from launching on Steam Deck. Added missing `Tuple` import to `progress_models.py`

### Bug Fixes
- **Menu Routing**: Fixed "Configure Existing Modlist (In Steam)" opening wrong section (was routing to Wabbajack Installer instead of Configure Existing screen)
- **TTW Install Dialogue**: Fixed incorrect account reference (changed "mod.db" to "ModPub" to match actual download source)
- **Duplicate Method**: Removed duplicate `_handle_missing_downloader_error` method in winetricks handler
- **Issue #142**: Removed sudo execution from modlist configuration - now auto-fixes permissions when possible, provides manual instructions only when sudo required
- **Issue #133**: Updated VDF library to 4.0 for improved Steam file format compatibility (protontricks 1.13.1+ support)

### Features
- **Wine Component Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for missing downloaders with platform-specific installation instructions (SteamOS/Steam Deck vs other distros)

### Dependencies
- **VDF Library**: Updated from PyPI vdf 3.4 to actively maintained solsticegamestudios/vdf 4.0 (used by Gentoo)
- **Winetricks**: Removed bundled downloaders that caused segfaults on some systems - now uses system-provided downloaders (aria2c/wget/curl)

---

## v0.2.1 - Wabbajack Installer and ENB Support
**Release Date:** 2025-01-12
Y
### Major Features
- **Automated Wabbajack Installation**: While I work on Non-Premium support, there is still a call for Wabbajack via Proton. The existing legacy bash script has been proving troublesome for some users, so I've added this as a new feature within Jackify. My aim is still to not need this in future, once Jackify can cover Non-Premium accounts.
- **ENB Detection and Configuration**: Automatic detection and configuration of `enblocal.ini` with `LinuxVersion=true` for all supported games
- **ENB Proton Warning**: Dedicated dialog with Proton version recommendations when ENB is detected

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **OAuth Token Stale State**: Re-check authentication before engine launch to prevent stale token errors after revocation
- **FNV SD Card Registry**: Fixed launcher not recognizing game on SD cards (uses `D:` drive for SD, `Z:` for internal)
- **CLI FILE_PROGRESS Spam**: Filter verbose output to preserve single-line progress updates
- **Steam Double Restart**: Removed legacy code causing double restart during configuration
- **TTW Installer lz4**: Fixed bundled lz4 detection by setting correct working directory

### Improvements
- **Winetricks Bundling**: Bundled critical dependencies (wget, sha256sum, unzip, 7z) for improved reliability
- **UI/UX**: Removed per-file download speeds to match Wabbajack upstream
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed PyInstaller references, use AppImage detection only
- **Wabbajack Installer UI**: Removed unused Process Monitor tab, improved Activity window with detailed step information
- **Steam AppID Overflow Fix**: Changed AppID handling to string type to prevent overflow errors with large Steam AppIDs

---

## v0.2.0.10 - Registry & Hashing Fixes
**Release Date:** 2025-01-04

### Engine Updates
- **jackify-engine 0.4.5**: Fixed archive extraction with backslashes (including pattern matching), data directory path configuration, and removed post-download .wabbajack hash validation. Engine now auto-refreshes OAuth tokens during long installations via `NEXUS_OAUTH_INFO` environment variable.

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **InstallationThread Crash**: Fixed crash during installation with error "'InstallationThread' object has no attribute 'auth_service'". Premium detection diagnostics code assumed auth_service existed but it was never passed to the thread. Affects all users when Premium detection (including false positives) is triggered.
- **Install Start Hang**: Fixed missing `oauth_info` parameter that prevented modlist installs from starting (hung at "Starting modlist installation...")
- **OAuth Token Auto-Refresh**: Fixed OAuth tokens expiring during long modlist installations. Jackify now refreshes tokens with 15-minute buffer before passing to engine. Engine receives full OAuth state via `NEXUS_OAUTH_INFO` environment variable, enabling automatic token refresh during multi-hour downloads. Fixes "Token has expired" errors that occurred 60 minutes into installations.
- **ShowDotFiles Registry Format**: Fixed Wine registry format bug causing hidden files to remain hidden in prefixes. Python string escaping issue wrote single backslash instead of double backslash in `[Software\\Wine]` section header. Added auto-detection and fix for broken format from curated registry files.
- **Dotnet4 Registry Fixes**: Confirmed universal dotnet4.x registry fixes (`*mscoree=native` and `OnlyUseLatestCLR=1`) are applied in all three workflows (Install, Configure New, Configure Existing) across both CLI and GUI interfaces
- **Proton Path Configuration**: Fixed `proton_path` writing invalid "auto" string to config.json - now uses `null` instead, preventing jackify-engine from receiving invalid paths

### Improvements
- **Wine Binary Detection**: Enhanced detection with recursive fallback search within Proton directory when expected paths don't exist (handles different Proton version structures)
- Added Jackify version logging at workflow start
- Fixed GUI log file rotation to only run in debug mode
